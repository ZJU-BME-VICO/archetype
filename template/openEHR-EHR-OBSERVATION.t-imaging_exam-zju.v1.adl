Use to record the imaging examination components (only) of a more complex procedure, including those that may have been undertaken under imaging guidance.

More complex procedures (such as echocardiaograms or Bone density scans) may be represented using templates or specialised archetypes where additional report content is appropriate.

Not to be used to record details about any parallel procedure undertaken. Use the specific procedure-related archetypes, for example ACTION.procedure.
